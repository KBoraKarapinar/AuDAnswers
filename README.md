My solutions to the coding assignments for the Algorithms and Data Structures course, which I completed at the Technical University of Darmstadt.

Grades:

Assignment 1: 28/30

Assignment 2: 29/30

Although the entire framework (and hereby the code) is not solely my own due to the nature of the assignment structure, I primarily coded the relationships between individual components and the execution of the defined/given main task.
